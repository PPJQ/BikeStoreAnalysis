# [ðŸš² Bike Store Analysis](#content-table)
 Project of an analysis of a Bike Store to practice SQL, Excel and Tableau.

For this project we are going to use SQL Server for the database. Then we are going to connect our dataset to Excel and we are going to create an interactive Dashboard. And finally we are going to connect our Excel dataset to Tableau and also we are going to create a Dashboard.

# [SQL](#content-table) 

In this section we need to understand what are the necessities of the business.

They want to know:
* The state of the sales activities within the company and gain insight into the various trance happening in the sales volume over the period 2016 to 2018.

* The revenue per region, store, product category and brand. 

* A list of the top customers and sales representatives.

With this in mind, let's take a look at the data and create a query to get all the information that we need to solve this problem.

Let's start with the period of time, we will obtain this information in the orders table:

```sql
SELECT 
  MIN(order_date) AS "Min Date", 
  MAX(order_date) AS "Max Date" 
FROM 
  sales.orders;
```

This query give us the following result:

<div class=center>

  <table border="1">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th></td>
        <th>Min Date</th>
        <th>Max Date</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>2016-01-01</td>
        <td>2018-12-28</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

</div>

So information that we have correspond to the period of time of our analysis.

For the data that we need to collect is: 

* order id
* order date
* customer name
* sales representative name
* region
* store
* product 
* brand
* quantity
* price
* discount

Let's begin with the order id, customer name and order date

```sql
SELECT
  ord.order_id,
  CONCAT(cust.first_name,' ',cust.last_name) as "Customer Name",
  cust.city,
  cust.state,
  ord.order_date
FROM
  sales.orders ord
  LEFT JOIN sales.customers cust ON cust.customer_id= ord.customer_id;
```
<div class=center>
<img src="./img/order and customers query.png">
</div>

Now let's summarize the quantity of products and the revenue.

```sql
SELECT
  ord.order_id,
  CONCAT(cust.first_name,' ',cust.last_name) AS "customer_name",
  cust.city,
  cust.state,
  ord.order_date,
  SUM(items.quantity) AS "total_units",
  SUM(items.quantity * items.list_price) AS "revenue"
 FROM
  sales.orders ord
  LEFT JOIN sales.customers cust ON cust.customer_id= ord.customer_id
  LEFT JOIN sales.order_items items ON items.order_id = ord.order_id
GROUP BY
  ord.order_id,
  CONCAT(cust.first_name,' ',cust.last_name),
  cust.city,
  cust.state,
  ord.order_date;
```

<div>
<img src="./img/orders customers units and revenue query.png">
</div>


Now let's add the product.

```sql
SELECT
  ord.order_id,
  CONCAT(cust.first_name,' ',cust.last_name) AS "customer_name",
  cust.city,
  cust.state,
  ord.order_date,
  SUM(items.quantity) AS "total_units",
  SUM(items.quantity * items.list_price) AS "revenue",
  prod.product_name
 FROM
  sales.orders ord
  LEFT JOIN sales.customers cust ON cust.customer_id= ord.customer_id
  LEFT JOIN sales.order_items items ON items.order_id = ord.order_id
  LEFT JOIN production.products prod ON prod.product_id = items.product_id
GROUP BY
  ord.order_id,
  CONCAT(cust.first_name,' ',cust.last_name),
  cust.city,
  cust.state,
  ord.order_date,
  prod.product_name;
```

<div class=center>
<img src="./img/orders customers units revenue and product name query.png">
</div>

Now let's add the category

```sql
SELECT
  ord.order_id,
  CONCAT(cust.first_name,' ',cust.last_name) AS "customer_name",
  cust.city,
  cust.state,
  ord.order_date,
  SUM(items.quantity) AS "total_units",
  SUM(items.quantity * items.list_price) AS "revenue",
  prod.product_name,
  cat.category_name
 FROM
  sales.orders ord
  LEFT JOIN sales.customers cust ON cust.customer_id= ord.customer_id
  LEFT JOIN sales.order_items items ON items.order_id = ord.order_id
  LEFT JOIN production.products prod ON prod.product_id = items.product_id
  LEFT JOIN production.categories cat ON cat.category_id = prod.category_id
GROUP BY
  ord.order_id,
  CONCAT(cust.first_name,' ',cust.last_name),
  cust.city,
  cust.state,
  ord.order_date,
  prod.product_name,
  cat.category_name
```

<div class=center>
<img src="./img/orders customers units revenue product category.png">
</div>
Next the brand name

```sql
SELECT
  ord.order_id,
  CONCAT(cust.first_name,' ',cust.last_name) AS "customer_name",
  cust.city,
  cust.state,
  ord.order_date,
  SUM(items.quantity) AS "total_units",
  SUM(items.quantity * items.list_price) AS "revenue",
  prod.product_name,
  cat.category_name,
  brand.brand_name
 FROM
  sales.orders ord
  LEFT JOIN sales.customers cust ON cust.customer_id= ord.customer_id
  LEFT JOIN sales.order_items items ON items.order_id = ord.order_id
  LEFT JOIN production.products prod ON prod.product_id = items.product_id
  LEFT JOIN production.categories cat ON cat.category_id = prod.category_id
  LEFT JOIN production.brands brand ON brand.brand_id = prod.brand_id
GROUP BY
  ord.order_id,
  CONCAT(cust.first_name,' ',cust.last_name),
  cust.city,
  cust.state,
  ord.order_date,
  prod.product_name,
  cat.category_name,
  brand.brand_name
```

<div class=center>
<img src="./img/brand query.png">
</div>

And now the store name

```sql
SELECT
  ord.order_id,
  CONCAT(cust.first_name,' ',cust.last_name) AS "customer_name",
  cust.city,
  cust.state,
  ord.order_date,
  SUM(items.quantity) AS "total_units",
  SUM(items.quantity * items.list_price) AS "revenue",
  prod.product_name,
  cat.category_name,
  brand.brand_name,
  store.store_name
 FROM
  sales.orders ord
  LEFT JOIN sales.customers cust ON cust.customer_id= ord.customer_id
  LEFT JOIN sales.order_items items ON items.order_id = ord.order_id
  LEFT JOIN production.products prod ON prod.product_id = items.product_id
  LEFT JOIN production.categories cat ON cat.category_id = prod.category_id
  LEFT JOIN production.brands brand ON brand.brand_id = prod.brand_id
  LEFT JOIN sales.stores store ON store.store_id = ord.store_id
GROUP BY
  ord.order_id,
  CONCAT(cust.first_name,' ',cust.last_name),
  cust.city,
  cust.state,
  ord.order_date,
  prod.product_name,
  cat.category_name,
  brand.brand_name,
  store.store_name
```

<div class=center>
<img src="./img/store query.png">
</div>

Finally let's add the sales rep

```sql
SELECT
  ord.order_id,
  CONCAT(cust.first_name,' ',cust.last_name) AS "customer_name",
  cust.city,
  cust.state,
  ord.order_date,
  SUM(items.quantity) AS "total_units",
  SUM(items.quantity * items.list_price) AS "revenue",
  prod.product_name,
  cat.category_name,
  brand.brand_name,
  store.store_name,
  CONCAT(staff.first_name,' ',staff.last_name) AS "staff_name"
 FROM
  sales.orders ord
  LEFT JOIN sales.customers cust ON cust.customer_id= ord.customer_id
  LEFT JOIN sales.order_items items ON items.order_id = ord.order_id
  LEFT JOIN production.products prod ON prod.product_id = items.product_id
  LEFT JOIN production.categories cat ON cat.category_id = prod.category_id
  LEFT JOIN production.brands brand ON brand.brand_id = prod.brand_id
  LEFT JOIN sales.stores store ON store.store_id = ord.store_id
  LEFT JOIN sales.staffs staff ON staff.staff_id = ord.staff_id
GROUP BY
  ord.order_id,
  CONCAT(cust.first_name,' ',cust.last_name),
  cust.city,
  cust.state,
  ord.order_date,
  prod.product_name,
  cat.category_name,
  brand.brand_name,
  store.store_name,
  CONCAT(staff.first_name,' ',staff.last_name)
```

<div class=center>
  <img src="./img/staff query.png">
</div>

Now we already have our dataset prepared, let's continue with the next step.

# [Excel Dashboard](#content-table)

For the Excel Dashboard we are going to export the dataset.

In a new workbook, we are going to connect our database to Excel with query that we just made in the previous section: 

<div class=center>
  <img src="./img/Excel db connection.png">
</div>
<div>
  <img src="./img/data load to excel.png">
</div>

Data loaded in the following file:

### [Link to Excel Dashboard](BikeStores%20Excel.xlsx)

In our Excel workbook we will create three sheets: 

  * Data
  * Pivot Tables
  * Dashboard

In the "Data" sheet, as the name suggests, it's for the data that we import into Excel.

The "Pivot Tables" sheet, we will create the pivot tables that answers the following points: 

* Revenue per Year
* Revenue per Month over the three years
* Revenue per State
* Revenue per Store
* Revenue per Brand
* Revenue per Product Category
* Top 10 Customers By Revenue
* Top Sales Rep By Revenue

Of course, each pivot table will have its own chart.

To make our Dashboard more interactive, we are going to add slicers that are going to help us to filter our charts. Those slicers are going to be for: 

* Year
* State 
* Store

After doing all that, we have our "**Executive Dashboard**":

<div class=center>
  <img src="./img/Executive Dashboard-1.png">
  
</div>
<div class=center>
    <img src="./img/Executive Dashboard-2.png">
</div>

<div>
  <p>
    <! it's to separate a little bit the last images of the title below -->
  </p>
</div>

# [Tableau Dashboard](#content-table)

For this section we are going to load our Excel file to access to the query developed in the first section.

Once we load our data, we are going to create the following charts: 

* Revenue Per Year
* Revenue Per Month
* Revenue Per State
* Revenue Per Store
* Revenue Per Brand
* Revenue Per Category
* Revenue Per Sales Rep

Also we are going to create a filter that will allow us to select the year of the dashboard charts.

For our dashboard we also are going to create a banner that contain the following information: 

* Total Revenue
* Customers
* \# Orders
* Total Units

You can review the dashboard in the following link:
